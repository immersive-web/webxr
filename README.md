# WebVR Community Group & Specification

WebVR is driving support for accessing virtual reality (VR) devices, including sensors and head-mounted displays on the Web.

This is the repository for the [WebVR Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/) and the [WebVR Specification](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/). We have a [charter](charter/index.html) (in progress).

* [Gamepad Specification](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/), introduces a low-level interface that represents gamepad devices
* [Gamepad Extensions Specification](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html), extends the Gamepad API to enable access to more advanced device capabilities
